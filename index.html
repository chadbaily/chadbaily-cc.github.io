							<h2>Why Computer Science is More than a Degree</h2>
						</header>
						Computer Science is more than a degree because it enables you to do so much more than simply code programs. It gives you
						group skill and collaboration skills that are necessary in professional environments. Resources such as Git and GitHub
						allow for easier group projects. Computer Science also allows you to be more creative and invent new things that havenâ€™t
						been done before. Hackathons provide a great learning experience and help to spark new ideas that may have been missed.</p>

							<p>Programming is only part of being a programmer, the other half are the non-programming skills. I am proficient in Agile methodology and Khanban based project development.
								I am also currently studying to take the AWS Developer certification and attended AWS:re-invent in the winter of 2019. I am a large proponent of test-driven-development and 
									am always helping push my team to be the best we can be.

								<h3>Application Notes</h3>
							</header>
							<p>I created documentation for a connection between a TI cc3200 LAUNCHPADXL to a S8 1% CO2 sensor. The documentation
								went through many different levels of processing. It includes many pictures and detailed descriptions of the processes
								needed to replicate from start to finish the procedure of connecting the two devices. </p>

								<h3>Sapphire Doodles Website</h3>
							</header>
							<p>One of my more recent projects is the Sapphire Doodles Website. This is a family website that I manage and is hosted
								by GoDaddy. The website is clean and elegant while being engaging for customers. There were many different templates
								that were used from HTML-5UP to complete the website. It is also open source and all of the code is hosted on my
								GitHub.

								<h3>UART Connections</h3>
							</header>
							<p>With help of documentation, I was able to take a COZIR Ambient 2/10K CO2 + RH/T Sensor and an S8 1% CO2 Sensor and
								communicate with them via the Raspberry pi's UART connections This was done through the Raspberry pi's USB ports.
								The data form the sensors is logged and can be stored into a MySQL database located on the Raspberry Pi. This data
								can then be sent to IoT sites like thingspeak.com to be accessed around the globe.</p>

								<h3>Helpers Help Me!</h3>

							<p>During my sophomore year at Stetson University, I was put in charge of managing a team of 9 other students to create
								a website to log and host volunteer events. The entire website was programmed in C++ using different aids including
								CGI CC and sqlite3. The website is available for download on GitHub and is completely open-source.</p>

								<h3>Informaiton Technology Monitoring Wall</h3>

							<p>During my 2016 summer internship at Virginia 529 College Savings plan, I implemented at physical and virtual server
								monitoring board. I connected to each physical server through its VMWare monitoring IP, then pulled the information
								from the website and displayed it using PHP code. Graphs were generated by Google Charts to provide a nice esthetic
								to the board.</p>
